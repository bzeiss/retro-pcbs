# retro-pcbs
This site contains some stuff I have built for old retro computers.

I tinker with electronics, release stuff when I feel like it and I make it public when it's maybe not perfect. I'm not an electronics expert, so I may not always know what I'm doing. I learn the necessary electronics as I use it. Use at your own risk.

Be smart. Don't just trust the stuff I offer for download here. Take a look at schematics and PCB designs beforehand ;-)

Feedback is always very welcome ðŸ˜„ Feel free to ask question in the [discussions](https://github.com/bzeiss/retro-pcbs/discussions).
