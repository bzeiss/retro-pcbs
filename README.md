# retro-pcbs
This site contains some stuff I have built for old retro computers.

I tinker with electronics, release stuff when I feel like it and I make it public when it's not perfect. I'm not an electronics expert, so I may not always know what I'm doing. I learn the necessary electronics as I use it. Use at your own risk.

Be smart. Don't just trust the stuff I offer for download here. Take a look at schematics and PCB designs beforehand ;-)

Feedback is always very welcome ðŸ˜„

## WP32 McCake 5.25" bay

This is a 5.25" bay for retro PCs that use the [https://www.serdashop.com/](Serdaco/Serdashop) WP32 McCake [https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi](mt32-pi) waveblaster extension.

The bay is work in progress and test prints and test pcbs have been ordered, but not yet verified to be all working together as expected.
